- Iâ€™m currently learning Reactjs, Redux, React Native
- Things I have in my repertoire so far:
  - MongoDB, Express, Node, Python, Heroku, Netlify, Firebase, REST APIs, APIs, HTML5, CCS, JavaScript, Bootstrap

## Some of the projects I've built:
- Timesheet Web (Nodejs): https://github.com/bernardmuller/timesheet
