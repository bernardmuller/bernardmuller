  - I'm building projects with the goal of landing a job in software development.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a recipe app to automate my grocery lists and other smaller projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Reactjs, Redux, React Native
- 💡 My repertoire so far:
  - MongoDB, Express, Nodejs, Python, Heroku, Netlify, Firebase, REST APIs, APIs, HTML5, CCS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Reactjs
