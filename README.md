# Hi there 👋, I'm Bernard. 

### I like to spend my free time getting frustrated by fixing broken code that I have written.

- Architectural Technologist by day, self-taught programmer by night. I'm building projects with the goal of landing a job in software development.
- I’m currently working on a recipe app to automate my grocery lists and my personal site: https://bernardmuller.netlify.app/
- I’m currently learning Reactjs, Redux, React Native
- Things I have in my repertoire so far:
  - MongoDB, Express, Node, Python, Heroku, Netlify, Firebase, REST APIs, APIs, HTML5, CCS, JavaScript, Bootstrap

## Some of the projects I've built:
- Timesheet Web: https://github.com/bernardmuller/timesheet
- Dad Joke Generator: https://bernardmuller.github.io/DadJokeGenerator/

### Feel free to say hi!
